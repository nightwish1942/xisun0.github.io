This paper examines stock market returns in an environment in which the dates of central bank's information supply through public announcements are not pre-fixed. We document that positive excess returns accumulate for 3 days before China's central bank releases data of monetary aggregates, which may be announced either early or late in a month. In particular, large pre-announcement premium is associated with late arrivals of announcements. We then present a model to rationalize these facts by highlighting the channel of investors' rational attention allocation reacting to unscheduled deliveries of announcements. Investors with limited attention would learn about the to-be-announced data only when it's late in an announcement cycle, whereby an announcement is still pending but investors know better the announcement would soon arrive. Increasingly focused attention then drives down market uncertainty and boosts equity prices ex-ante. We show that China's unique setting of "quasi-scheduled" central bank announcements provides the exact data structure for identifying the \emph{causal} mechanism of the attention allocation channel

- **Hold-up Problem with the Government: Evidence from China** (with Jiaoliang Jiang and Chanyun Wang) [[SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3423523)]  
_presented at 2020 CES North America Conference, NYU(PhD Seminar)_  
This paper studies the hold-up problem with the government, namely that the government may be provided an opportunity to expropriate firm investment in an incomplete contract. We employ the enactment of the 2007 Property Law in China as a natural experiment to empirically test the effect of the hold-up problem. We document that firm investments increase 12% on average after the Law enactment, and this effect tends to be stronger for private enterprises. We then provide evidence from four perspectives suggesting that mitigating the risks of being held up by the government may encourage firm investment. We show that in the post-enactment period firms become less likely to withhold their investments during local government official rotations. We also find a larger post-enactment increase in investments for firms headquartered in regions with more local government fiscal pressure, more corruption, and worse government-business relations which may indicate a higher prevalence of the hold-up problem. Our findings hold for a group of robustness checks and are valid after taking account of alternative explanations.
